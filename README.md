# Stock Volatility Forecasting Tool

This Jupyter notebook contains code for evaluating various prediction methods for stock volatility.

## Overview

The notebook generates a table that compares the performance of different prediction methods. Each method's performance is assessed in three different contexts:

1. **MSE All Stocks**: This measures the method's performance on predicting the volatility for all stocks in the dataset. Some prediction methods do not have separate "Trained Stocks" and "Other Stocks" categories due to the nature of the method. For these methods, all stocks are used for training. This is reflected in the "MSE All Stocks" column.

2. **MSE Trained Stocks**: This measures the method's performance on just the stocks that the method was trained on. Note that for some methods, this category may not be applicable.

3. **MSE Other Stocks**: This measures the method's performance on the stocks that were not included in the training set. Again, for some methods, this category may not be applicable.

The three best-performing methods in each category are highlighted for easy comparison.

## Requirements
